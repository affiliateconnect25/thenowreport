<h1>Why Gen Z Will Change the Election (If We Show Up)</h1>
<div class="subtitle">“We’ve been told we’re too online to vote. That’s why we will.”</div>
</div>
<div class="body-text">
<p>Generation Z, often abbreviated as Gen Z, comprises individuals born between the mid-to-late 1990s and the early 2010s. This generation is now stepping into adulthood, with millions becoming eligible to vote in local and national elections for the first time...</p>
<h2>The Political Awakening of Gen Z</h2><p>From Parkland to Black Lives Matter to climate strikes, Gen Z has been at the heart of grassroots activism. They don’t wait for permission—they mobilize digitally and physically. Many were politicized as early as middle school. The urgency they feel around justice is what fuels their voting energy today.</p>
<p>The rise of Gen Z’s political consciousness didn’t happen overnight...</p>
<h2>Gen Z’s Digital Savvy: A Double-Edged Sword</h2><p>Being native to the internet, Gen Z is used to digesting complex information fast. But with that comes exposure to misinformation and algorithmic echo chambers. That’s why many teens follow fact-checkers, verify sources, and even educate each other online. Still, the flood of content can lead to burnout or political apathy.</p>
<p>Gen Z lives online. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter aren’t just for memes and dances—they're where this generation consumes news...</p>
<h2>Voting Trends Among Gen Z</h2><p>They vote when they feel seen. In 2022 midterms, Gen Z turned out at record levels in states where issues like abortion, climate, and debt relief were on the ballot. What matters most isn’t flashy campaigns—it’s authenticity. Candidates who speak to their real fears and dreams are the ones who earn their trust.</p>
<p>In the 2020 U.S. presidential election, nearly 50% of eligible Gen Z voters participated—a significant increase from past first-time voter groups...</p>
<h2>What Issues Matter Most to Gen Z Voters?</h2><p>Whether it's the planet's future or their own student loans, Gen Z is values-driven. They care less about political parties and more about results. They’re demanding action, not promises. And they're willing to vote third-party, protest, or organize if traditional systems don’t respond.</p>
<p><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Urgency to combat environmental degradation<br/>
<strong>Student Debt:</strong> Crushing loans impact life choices<br/>
<strong>Racial Justice:</strong> Demand for equality and reform<br/>
<strong>Gun Control:</strong> School shootings deeply impact youth</p>
<h2>Conclusion: This Is Our Moment, Gen Z</h2><p>Gen Z is no longer the future of politics—they're the present. With each election, their influence grows. Whether it's registering friends to vote, building platforms on TikTok, or calling out injustice, Gen Z is rewriting civic engagement in real-time. The challenge? Showing up. The reward? Real change.</p>
<p>Voting isn’t just about picking a leader—it’s about shaping the future. Gen Z holds the power to demand change and reimagine democracy. That’s why we’ll show up.</p>
